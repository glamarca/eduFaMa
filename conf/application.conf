# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
application.langs="fr,en"

# Logger
# ~~~~~
# You can also configure logback (http://logback.qos.ch/),
# by providing an application-logger.xml file in the conf directory.

# Root logger:
logger.root=ERROR

# Logger used by the framework:
logger.play=INFO

# Logger provided to your application:
logger.application=DEBUG

# Global object class
# ~~~~~
# Define the Global object class for this application.
# Default to Global in the root package.
# application.global=Global


# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# ~~~~~

# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
# More JDBC Config : https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.3.x/SettingsJDBC
#
# The JDBC driver to use
db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
# The JDBC url
db.default.url="jdbc:h2:file:./h2/test"
# User name
db.default.user=sa
# Password
db.default.password=secret
# Set a connection's default autocommit setting
db.default.autocommit=true
# Set a connection's default isolation level
#db.default.isolation=READ_COMMITTED

# Evolutions
# You can disable evolutions if needed
evolutionplugin=enabled

#Scheduled jobs
#You can configure cron expressions for scheduled jobs as configuration keys that start with cron. and use the key
#as the value of a @play.jobs.On or @Every annotation. For example, @On(“cron.noon”) refers to:

#cron.noon=0 0 12 * * ?

#Date formats
#sets the default date format, using a java.text.SimpleDateFormat pattern.
#This property also affects how ${date.format()} renders dates in templates.
#It also set the default date format when binding a date parameter.
#Default: yyyy-MM-dd
date.format=dd-MM-yyyy
#You can also set a different date format for specific languages that you have configured with application.langs,
#date.format.fr=dd-MM-yyyy
